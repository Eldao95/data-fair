### Title and description

The title and description of a visualization help to provide context, better understand the data and discover certain points put forward by the producer of the data.

### Metadata and action buttons

Metadata are available as a card. They contain the organization that published the visualization, the type of visualization, action buttons, and the date the visualization was updated.

Action buttons provide access to HTML code to embed the visualization on an external site as well as a full-screen presentation of the visualization.

### Sharing icons

Sharing icons allow you to quickly share the page link on different social networks.  
The share thumbnail is the visualization preview.
