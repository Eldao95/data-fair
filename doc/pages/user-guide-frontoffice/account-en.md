An account allows you to submit reuses as well as to have faster access when calling APIs.

In your personal area, you have access to the data provided and also the password renewal and deletion of your account.

## Submit a reuse

Once logged in you can submit a reuse from your personal space or directly on a data page.

Fill in the different elements of the reuse. As long as you have not submitted your reuse, you can modify it.

After submitting your reuse, using the green arrow, only the portal administrators will be able to modify and validate the submission.

### Notifications

The notifications section allows you to enable global notifications on the addition of datasets to the portal or the addition of a particular portal topic.   

For targeted notifications on datasets, visit the dataset page and click on the bell in the metadata.

### Clés d'API

API keys allow you to have a better throughput for your requests.  
You can create multiple API keys, the throughput will then be shared across all your keys.

* An anonymous user may not make more than 100 requests per 5-second interval. Its total download speed will be limited to 2 MB/s for static content (data files, attachments, etc.) and 500 kB/s for other calls.
* An authenticated user (session or API key) may not make more than 100 requests per 1 second interval. Its total download speed will be limited to 4 MB/s for static content (data files, attachments, etc.) and 1 MB/s for other calls.
