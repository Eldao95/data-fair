The number of datasets to which you have access as well as the dataset catalog download button is displayed on the first line of the page.  
The search function as well as filters by concepts and sorting are available.  
It is also possible to sort the datasets by theme by clicking on one or more of the themes displayed.

Each dataset is presented in the form of a card containing the title, the beginning of the description, the theme and action buttons.
The action buttons allow you to access the windowed or full-screen table, the API documentation, the dataset schema as well as the generic map of the datasets if it has contact information.

Clicking on the card takes you to the dataset page.
