The search bar as well as filters by type of visualization and sorting are available at the top of the page.
It is also possible to sort the visualizations by theme by clicking on one or more of the themes displayed.

Each visualization is presented in the form of a card containing the title, an overview of the visualization, the theme and action buttons.  
The action buttons allow you to access the visualization in a window or in full screen.

Clicking on the card takes you to the visualization page.
