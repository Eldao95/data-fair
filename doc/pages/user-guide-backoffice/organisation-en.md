An organization account allows to work together on the same datasets and visualizations with various persons.  
A personal account can create an organization.

### Create an organization

Organizations can be created in the **My Account** space of the the Data Fair menu.  
Click on the **Create an organization** button and fill in the title and description of your organization, you will then be the administrator of this new organization.

If you are an administrator of the organization, you can access [member management](./user-guide-backoffice/members). This allows you to invite members, define their roles, and remove members from your organization.

### Active account

If you are a member of an organization, you have access to the organization workspace.
