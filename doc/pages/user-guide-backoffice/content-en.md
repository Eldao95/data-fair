Content pages allow to highlight data, write articles, do data storytelling or even describe a license on your portal.  

### Create a content page

The **Portals** section of Data Fair allows you to access the configuration of your portals. You can then access the editing of **content pages** using the **Edit content pages** button at the top right.

Then click on the **create a new content page** button.

A menu is displayed allowing you to enter the parameters of your page:
* Published or/and Public
* The template allows you to choose a predefined page layout.
* The position in the menu, in direct link or in a submenu
* The page title
* Thematics

*Parameters of this menu can be modified later.*


On the image, the content page is called **Land**, has a **thematic** page template, a sub-menu layout and a **Thematic** as block name.

The **blank page** template allows to add and arrange the elements freely.  
The **thematic page** template allows to add description of the page and a banner.

### Configuration of your thematic page

On the left side of the editing page is the editorial content.  
On the right side of your page, there is a preview of your content page updated in real time.  

The editing part allows to add elements and page blocks like a CMS.

A block has different sections:
* The title
* General description
* The **visualization** you want to present
* The **associated datasets** which allow you to choose the datasets to highlight.
* **An accented text** which allows to highlight an important text such as an information, a success, a warning or an error.

You can use the following video as an example to complete your first block:  

<iframe width="560" height="315" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups" src="https://videos.koumoul.com/videos/embed/954b9a9c-055d-4b39-a8c8-4bf61c44264f?loop=1&warningTitle=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


Once your block has been edited, click on the pencil to exit edit mode.  
You can then create multiple custom blocks.  

After adding different blocks, you can **publish** your page so that it is accessible to visitors to your portal.  
For an opendata portal, your page must be public to be available to visitors of your portal.
