Network diagram allows to generate dynamic graphs from two datasets, one containing the nodes and the other containing the links between the nodes.  
An example of this visualization is the [relationship between the players of the France team and their clubs](https://opendata.koumoul.com/reuses/relation-entre-les-joueurs-de-l'equipe-de-france-et-leurs-clubs).
