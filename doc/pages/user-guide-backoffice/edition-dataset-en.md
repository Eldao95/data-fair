Datasets are represented by a card. To edit a dataset click on the card.  

The edition page contains several sections: structure, metadata, data, visualizations, data sharing, activity, action buttons and content.

## Structure

The **Structure** section contains of the Schema and the Enrichment.

### Schema


The data schema allows to visualize all of the columns in your dataset.  
Clicking on a column allows you to access the column information

1. Selected column
2. Label and description of the column
3. Key, type and cardinality of the column
4. [Concept](./user-guide-backoffice/concept) associated to the column

<p>
</p>

[Concepts](./user-guide-backoffice/concept) are known elements for the platform and are used in visualizations or the [enrichment](./user-guide-backoffice/enrichment).

*Visualize the schemas of your data and fill in concepts to make sense of your data*  

### Enrichment  

Enrichment allows to import columns from a reference base. It is possible to improuve you data and cross with data from open&nbsp;data such as the SIRENE database, INSEE data, the cadastre or the BAN.

Several steps are necessary to create a data enrichment:

1. On the schema, associate the [concepts](./user-guide-backoffice/concept) necessary for the enrichment you need.  
2. Choose the desired extension.  
3. Choose the columns you want to add and apply the enrichment

*Enrich your data get even more value*

The dataset will be processed and the progress can be viewed on the 6 different states of the dataset. Once the finalization step is complete, your data set is enriched.  

In the lower part of the enrichment sheet, you will find the enrichment log, as well as a button to delete the enrichment.  
The enrichment report allows you to check the quality of the enrichment and list the different lines that have not been enriched.

The columns that you have added to your dataset with [enrichment](./user-guide-backoffice/enrichment) will be automatically added to the dataset schema and it will be possible to download the enriched file with the additional columns.

## Metadata
The **Metadata** section is made up of Information and Attachments.  

### Informations
In this section, you will find information about your dataset, such as:  

* The title
* The description,
* the name, extension and size of your file
* Last update date of metadata and data
* Lines number
* License
* The thematic
* The source

### Attachments

Attachments are used to attach a document to data such as a description or documentation in a PDF file for example.  
The attached files will be available for download on the dataset page on your portals.

## Data

In this section, the data can be displayed in the form of a table, map, calendar or thumbnails.

**Table**

The table lets you access the first 10,000 rows of the file.

![Tableau](./images/user-guide-backoffice/edition-tableau-1.png)

It contains several sections:
1. search bar  
2. mode of visualization of the lines
3. columns choice  
4. download  
5. filters on a column  
6. the filter on a value of a column  



![Tableau](./images/user-guide-backoffice/edition-tableau-2.png)

1. Filters on column values allow you to perform an "equal to" or "begins with" filter on columns with text and to perform "greater than or equal to" or "less than or equal to" filters on columns with numbers or dates. You can make several filters. The number of filtered rows is then available next to the search.  
2. Download of the filtered rows in different formats.   
Downloading in XLSX, ODS and Geojson format is limited to the first 10,000 rows.

The column choices allow you to select the columns you want to display in the table.  
It is then possible to download the file with only the columns you have selected.

**Map**

The **Map** tab is available if position [concepts](./user-guide-backoffice/concept) such as lat/lon or geometry, are associated with your data.  

The map will allow you to quickly view your data on a territory and access raw data for each point or geometry.

**Calendar**  

The **Calendar** tab is available if the [concepts](./user-guide-backoffice/concept) Label, Start date and End date are associated with your data.  
The calendar will allow you to view your data chronologically.

**Thumbnails**

The order of the visualizations can be modified with a simple drag and drop of the visualization cards. This order will be applied on the dataset page of your portals.

![Visualisations](./images/user-guide-backoffice/dataset-visualisations-edit.jpg)

### Permissions

The list of your portals is available in this section.  

Datasets can be published to multiple portals. Broadcast of data in stages is possible, you can publish your data internally, get feedback, then publish the data on an opendata portal. Publishing on different portals increase the quality of the shared data with multiple feedback.  

Publishing on several portals allow to have the same data on all the portals without duplicating the data. In addition, when the data is updated, it will be updated for all portals.

* **Update**, allows you to modify the dataset loaded on your account with a new one from your computer.
* **Integrate on a site**, allows access to the HTML code to integrate the table or the data map to an external site.
* **View on the data portal**, allows access to the page on your portal. If you have published the dataset on more than one portal, there will be various links.
* **API**, provides access to the interactive documentation of the dataset API.
* **Delete**, remove the dataset from the platform.
* **Change owner**, allows you to transfer the dataset to another account.

## Contents

The content section allows you to quickly navigate between the different sections of the dataset edit page.
