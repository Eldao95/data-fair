The **Home Page** of your [active account](./user-guide-backoffice/organisation) is accessible using the navigation bar.


Depending on your rights in the organization, this page displays the **Contribute** and **Manage** datasets sections.

**Contribute** allows you to create, update and publish a dataset on your portals.

**Manage** allows you to validate the publications, to visualize the number of datasets in error and the number of datasets in draft.  
This section is only available to administrators.  

When you click on one of the 3 actions, you are redirected to the filtered datasets page.
