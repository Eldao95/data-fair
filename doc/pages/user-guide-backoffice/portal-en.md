Portals can be **public**, for open&nbsp;data, or **private** to share data internally.  

The portal configuration page is accessible through the navigation bar. A list of your portals is available.
You can **create, delete, configure and duplicate** your portals.

## Configure a portal

A portal can be created with the **Create a new portal** button.  
A default configuration is available on your portal.

When setting up your portal, you are working on a **Draft**. Once you are satisfied with your draft, you can save it to **Current Version**.
The **Current version** is the version presented to the visitors of your portal.

The **portal configuration** interface is divided into 5 parts:

1. The configuration menu allows to modify the various parameters of your portal.
2. Allows you to switch from draft to current version
3. The preview allows you to view the draft or the current version of your portal.
4. The **Publish draft** button allows you to switch your draft to the current version. The **Reset** button allows to return to the default configuration.
5. Edit content pages, allows you to add new written page to your portal
