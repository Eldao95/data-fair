The **Graphs / Networks** visualization allows to generate dynamic graphs from two datasets, one containing the nodes and the other containing the links. An example is the [tag network in Stackoverflow](https://opendata.koumoul.com/reuses/reseau-de-tags-dans-stackoverflow).

## Create a Graphs / Networks visualization

Click on **Visualizations** then on **Configure a visualization**.

The title of the visualization can be changed anytime.  
The **Informations** section shows a summary of the characteristics of your application.

## Configuration menu

The configuration menu contains two submenus: **Data** and **Render**.

### Dataset

In the **Data** menu, you choose the two datasets of your vizualization.

### Render

The **Render** menu allows to configure your graph.  
You can choose the rendering method, SVG or Canvas, the strength of the links to better space the nodes of your graph and the font size of your labels.

In the section **nodes** you configure the rendering of your nodes by choosing the size of your nodes, the field of the names of your nodes and the color of your nodes.

When you are satisfied with the preview click on **Save** to finalize your configuration.  
You can add a description at the bottom of the page and make your application public.  
You can consult it using the **consult** or **full screen** buttons.
