Data Fair allows to enhance your data and share it internally or in opendata.  

Your account allows to access the various features of Data Fair:

* [Upload your data](./user-guide/datasets)
* [Enrich your data](./user-guide/enrichment) to add even more value.
* Represent your data in [interactive visualizations](./user-guide/reuses) (graphics, maps, search engine ...).
* Share your data in datastories, portals or API.

It is possible to work alone (personal account) or in a group ([organization account](./user-guide/organisation)).
