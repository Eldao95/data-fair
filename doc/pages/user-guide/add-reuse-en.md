Interactive visualizations present and explore your data in a fun way.

The creation of a visualization can be initiated from the various buttons **Configure a visualization** available on Data Fair

Remark : Check your datasets to match the type of visualization you want to create and also check [the concepts](./user-guide/concept) on your dataset.
For example, to configure a map, the concepts **Latitude** and **Longitude** must be associated with the columns that contain these values ​​in your dataset. Please do [contact](https://koumoul.com/contact) us if you have any trouble.

Once you clicked on **Configure visualization** you are redirected to the configuration page of your visualization.  
This page is divided into several parts:

* **Metadata** at the top of the page with the title, description and thematic.
* **Configuration** which includes the configuration menu on the left and the visualization preview on the right
* **Share** section allows you to manage permissions, the sharing link for private viewing, publications on various portals and on external catalogs.
* **Activity** to keep track of the latest changes to your visualization.

On the right of the page, **action buttons** are available.

*Customize the rendering of your visualization*

## Configuration menu

The configuration menu consists of different sections which may differ depending on the application.  
The menu is made up of at least three sections, the **Data**, the **Render** (or **Presentation**) and finally the **Navigation**.  
The **Data** section allows you to choose the dataset used in the visualization.

## Preview

The preview allows you to view the rendering of your visualisation. The preview is split into two modes **sketch** and **Registered Version**.  

When you make changes to the configuration menu, they are directly represented in the **sketch** mode of the preview. You can modify and test different renderings of your visualization. When you are satisfied with your rendering, click on the **Save** button and the **Registered Version** will change to represent the saved visualization.  


## Share my visualization

A visualization can be public or private. By default, a visualization is private.  
If your data is accessible to the public then your visualization can also be accessible to the public.  

The **Protected link** section allows to create a link to access a private visualization.

Visualizations can be published on multiple portals. It's possible to publish your visualization internally to get feedback from your team and then publish the visualization on an opendata portal for exemple.
