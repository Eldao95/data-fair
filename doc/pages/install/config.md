## Variables

*Data&nbsp;Fair* supports quite a large number of parameters that are documented below. We try as much as possible to define sensible default values, still some parameters will almost always need to be overridden, these parameters have **IMPORTANT** in their descriptions.

Parameters can be overridden by directly modifying the files, but the recommanded way is to use environment variables.

{{CONFIG_VARS}}
