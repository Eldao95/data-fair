All Data Fair functionality is exposed at the API levels. API can be requested outside the portal, but for restricted access it is necessary to use an **API key**.
The different possible uses of the API are described in more detail in [this section](./interoperate/api).

When creating an API key, it is possible to restrict access to a single function. It is then possible to restrict access to a specific IP or domain name.
