The home page is the main entry point to the data portal. It allows **quick access to data** based on themes and a text search field. **Key figures** make it possible to quantify the data present on the portal

It is possible to highlight **editorial content** (text explaining the approach or presenting the portal) as well as a visualization of data which can be used directly on this page. We can, for example, highlight a map showing the location of vaccination centers, or canteen menus for the week.
As part of a communication process, it is also possible to display a Twitter feed on this page.

For regular visitors, sections present the **latest datasets added** as well as the latest visualizations made, with a quick navigation to see this new content in more detail.

It is possible to customize which elements are displayed on this page, to display a banner instead of editorialized text or even to use a visualization instead of the banner! This last option allows you to present a **carousel with navigation links**.
