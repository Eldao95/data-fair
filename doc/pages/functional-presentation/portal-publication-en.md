Datasets and visualizations can be published to **multiple portals.**  
Once the permissions on your data or your visualizations are defined, the **Portal** subsection of the **Sharing** section allows you to choose on which portal you want to publish your resources.  
If your data is public, it can be published on all available portals. If they have restricted access, they can only be published on portals with authentication.

This publication mechanism makes it possible to work in an agile way for the publication of a dataset: we can for example have a **recipe portal** on which we publish the datasets that we wish to open soon, by accompanying them with visualizations.

Visualizations can highlight a problem in the data or a bad structuring of it, problem that can be seen by several people because the data is already published on a portal. Once we reach the **desired publication quality**, we unpublish the dataset from the recipe portal and publish it on one or more production portals.
