One of the main interests of a data portal is to allow different data to circulate better and therefore to be reused as much as possible. To highlight this approach, it is possible to publish pages listing the different uses of the published data.

The interest of these pages is twofold. For the data producer, this enhances his action of making his data available and helps to reinforce him in this sharing process. For the user of the data, this offers him a way to be referenced and to highlight his project which uses the data of the portal.

Data reuse pages can be created by portal administrators, but it is also possible to allow registered users to submit new pages. These submissions are then subject to moderation and it is the administrator who chooses to publish the reuse or not.
