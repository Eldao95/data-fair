**Portals** allow Data Fair users to present datasets and visualizations.

A data portal consists of a home page, a page that lists data, a page that lists visualizations, and content pages.  
The home page presents key figures, the last elements added as well as featured content.  
The data page provides access to data sources and the ability to perform **multi-criteria searches**, while the visualizations page provides quick access to the different visualizations.

The data portal has a responsive design and its display is suitable for a wide variety of terminals, allowing use on **fixed or mobile workstations**.

An **authentication screen** is accessible on all the pages of the portal to be able to connect or create an account. The account allows access to private data according to its rights. If the portal is on a domain name other than Data Fair, it is no longer possible to authenticate through it and the pattern no longer appears: the portal is in this case intended for open date.

The footer allows to integrate various links such as the conditions of use, the contact page and the institutional site, among others.

The **portal is configurable**, the configuration points are as follows:

* Title and Description
* Choice of main and secondary colors
* Logo, favicone and home image
* View portal key figures (number of datasets, records and visualizations)
* Choice of visualization highlighted
* Show data, visualizations and contact page links in navigation bar
* Show the latest datasets and visualizations added on the homepage
