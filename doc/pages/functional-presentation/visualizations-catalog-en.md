Like datasets, a catalog page of visualizations is available with a **search engine** and tools to filter or sort visualizations.

Visualizations are presented through **image thumbnails**. As with datasets, these tiles have different action buttons so you can quickly **interact** with the visualization or navigate to a full-screen view of it.  
Clicking on a thumbnail title or image navigates to the visualization's details page.
