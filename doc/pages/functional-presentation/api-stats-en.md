Data Fair and the various associated services make extensive use of cache mechanisms to improve access times to resources, so precise statistics on the use of the various access points of the platform can only be extracted afterwards. A module allows to extract **usage statistics** of APIs from the HTTP logs of services such as Nginx.

API access logs are published on Data Fair as a private dataset. Dataset can be used for consultation like another dataset, we can make visualizations on it and it is planned to create a content page presenting different views of this data in the form of a dashboard.
