Interactive visualizations allow data to be presented in a fun way and quickly understood. They are served by lightweight web applications ([This section](./interoperate/applications) describes how to create them). Visualizations can be configured through an interface that does not **require any programming skills**.

The configuration menu consists of different sections which differ according to the applications. Most of the time, the menu consists of three sections: data source, rendering options, and navigation related items. It is often possible to filter the data if you do not want to represent the entire dataset.

A preview renders the visualization. When changes are made in the configuration menu, they are directly represented in the preview. It is possible to quickly modify and test different renderings of the visualization. When the rendering is satisfactory, saving makes it possible to validate the modifications. The changes are then visible to all users of the visualization.


A visualization is private. It can be made public later. In any case, it is recommended to fill in a description. This description will be visible on the visualization's consultation page.

Data Fair offers a wide variety of constantly growing visualizations.
