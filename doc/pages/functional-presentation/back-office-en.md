The **back office** allows you to manage different elements on the platform: data, visualizations, portals, members of organizations, permissions, connectors to other data catalogs (input or output) and periodic treatments. It also provides access to operating metrics

Access to the back office is of course restricted to authenticated users, in particular to users with administrator or contributor roles.
