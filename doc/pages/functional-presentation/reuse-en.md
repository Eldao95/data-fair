Users connected to the portal can **share the reuses** they have made from portal data.  
A specific page allows them to fill in the name of their reuse, the description, select the dataset used, a main image, a URL where the reuse is publicly accessible.

An administrator **validates** the reuse before it is displayed on the portal.

Users can tag external reuses they like via a like system. External reuses can be sorted by date, alphabetical order or number of likes on the page highlighting them.

A platform administrator decides to **promote or hide** a particular reuse.
