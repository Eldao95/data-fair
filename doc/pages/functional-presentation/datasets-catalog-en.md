The portal provides **quick access** to all the datasets published thanks to a page presenting the different sources. Each source is presented through a thumbnail which indicates its title, description, date of update and offers several actions:
* **Preview** the data with a tabular view in which you can sort the columns, paginate, carry out fulltext searches and download filtered data
* **Access** the interactive API documentation
* **Consult** the data schema

Clicking on a thumbnail title or description navigates to a dataset details page.  


The list of datasets can be browsed using an infinite scrolling mechanism, suitable for **desktop or mobile** use. Different tools allow you to search in this list, filter it by theme or sort it according to different criteria.
