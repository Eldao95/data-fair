A license defines the **rights** to use, share and access data. The themes make it possible to better **catalogue** the data. Data Fair makes it easy to manage the lists of licenses and thematics you need for your data.

A license is defined by its name and the address of a page which describes the contents of this license.

The licenses and themes added in your configuration can then be assigned to the data. The licenses and themes of your data will be available for consultation on your portal.
