The configuration of the data portal is done in a **graphic** interface in two steps: you work on a draft which you then publish in the current version. The *current version* is the version that is presented to the various visitors to your portal, which allows you to update the portal without impacting users until the draft has been validated.

Few configuration elements: the logo, the home image, the favicon, the color of the navigation bar, the color of the footer, content elements (title, description, visualization to highlight, public or private visibility ) and various communication elements (website, contact email and twitter account)

It is possible to set up a [Google Analytics or Matomo (ex Piwik)](./analytics) account for activity monitoring and have **statistics** on the most visited pages and the most downloaded data.
