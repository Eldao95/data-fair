Datasets are presented with **visualizations adapted to the data** to be accessible to as many people as possible. Visitors can quickly absorb the data and **interact** with it.

Various tools allow a more informed public to be able to go further (downloading, use of the API, sharing, access to metadata, ...)

The information thumbnail presents the data producer, the associated license, the date of the last update as well as various action buttons. These actions are the same as those on the thumbnails of the data catalog, and you can also **download the data**.

Below the title and description of the data, the visualizations associated with the dataset are presented with their description, which allows you to **give meaning to your data**, tell a story and highlight different aspects of the dataset or possible use cases.

The visualizations are **interactive** and it is possible to access the page of the visualization by clicking on its title.

This thumbnail presents the first visualization associated with the dataset, and this graphical side helps to **increase the engagement** of social network users.
