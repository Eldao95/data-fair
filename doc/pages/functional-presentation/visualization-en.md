Each visualization is presented through a **dedicated page** which allows to add context, a title and description, and different actions. It is possible to access the full-screen visualization and retrieve an HTML code that allows the visualization to be embedded in another website.

As with datasets pages, there are various buttons at the bottom of the page to **share** the visualization page on various social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, etc.).

The visualization page has **enriched metadata** which allows better indexing by search engines and display of a thumbnail on social networks.
