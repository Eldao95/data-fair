Each visualization is presented through a **dedicated page** which allows it to be associated with context, title and description, as well as to offer different actions to the user. It is possible to access the visualization in full screen (the visualizations can be consulted both on **desktop and smartphone**) and to recover an HTML code which allows the visualization to be embedded in another website.

Just like for the datasets, there are different buttons at the bottom of the page to **share** the visualization page on different social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, ...).

The visualization page has **enriched metadata** which allows better indexing by search engines and the display of a thumbnail on social networks.
