All features of data management, cataloging, user management and statistics are available through **documented Rest APIs**.

API documentation is done following the **OpenAPI 3.0** specification. This allows clear and understandable documentation through interactive documentation. Developers can quickly acces and handle the API's.

Another benefit of using this specification is increased **interoperability**, with some computer systems (e.g. API gateways) being able to understand this specification.

The different possible uses of the API are described in more detail in [this section](./interoperate/api)..

It is possible to use the API to **harvest data from a portal**. For example, the site https://www.opendatarchives.fr/ regularly harvests data from the portal https://data.ademe.fr/ powered by Data Fair.
